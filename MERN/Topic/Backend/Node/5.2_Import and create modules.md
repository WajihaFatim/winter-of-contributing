## What are Node modules ?

In Node. js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality
 Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders
## Why do we use it?
The major advantage of Modularity is reusability. We don’t need to redevelop the same existing functionality. We can import a Module and reuse that module functionality very easily.

## IMPORTING NODEjs MODULES
First we install the module using command in the terminal in the your project directory .  

          npm install module_name

 - After it has been installed you can see  it is mentioned in the dependencies in the package.json

 After that,we import it using **require()** function.
This **require()** call import the specified module and cached into the application so that we don’t need to import it again and again.

### SYNTAX :
     

          var some-name= require('module-name')     
      
         

### EXAMPLE
•	Import Nodejs built-in “express” module.  


          var express= require('express')     
      
         
•	Import Nodejs built-in “mongoose”  module.


          var mong= require('mongoose')     
      

This **require()** call is similar to “import” statement in Java. We use import statement to import a package, class, interface etc into another class or interface.

Now Lets see,


## HOW TO CREATE A NODEjs MODULE

Step 1 : Create a package.json file using the command below in your directory  

              npm init

Step 2 : Provide responses for the required fields (name and version) ,as well as     
                the main field .
            name : name of your module
            version:the initial module version (recommended 1.0.1)

Step 3: Now create the file that will be loaded when your module will be    
             called by other application.
            In that file add a function as a property of the exports object. This
             will make the function available to other code:
             
```
                  exports.printMsg( )  =>{
                          console.log(“This message is from npm-pkg-module”);
                        }
```

Step 4 : Publish your module
         For private packages  use    `    npm publish  `   
          For public access use           `   npm publish --acess  public  `

Step 5 :  On Command line create a new test directory
- Change your directory to test directory that should be out of your project.

- Now install your module using command below:  
 `   npm install module_name  `

-	On the same directory create a test.js file which requires your module
and calls  your  module as a method .

-	On the command line, run command  
 ```
     node test.js 
     
  ```
     
    
Now the message sent to the console will appear .
